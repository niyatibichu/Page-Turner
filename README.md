# Page-Turner
â€¢	Created a website where users are able to browse through books, mark read books and also the ones they wish to read by adding them in the bookshelf. Javascript/jQuery, Node.js and MongoDB were used to build this application. Google Books API was used as a third-party Web Service API to fetch books list.
